//! The control plane's chat: talk to an agent (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex,
//! Gemini…) in a structured thread (streamed text, tool calls, interrupt)
//! while the agent drives deck itself through the `deck` CLI: it can open
//! terminals beside the chat, run servers there, and open pages in deck's
//! browser.
//!
//! The session machinery (adapters, the tokio↔gpui driver, the canonical
//! transcript) comes from yourcode's agent crates; this module is only the
//! view and the wiring.

/// What every agent is told about running inside deck. Appended to the

const HARNESS: &str = "\
You are running inside deck, a macOS workspace of terminals, a browser and \
coding agents. Drive it with the `deck` CLI, already on PATH and authorised \
for this session. Output is JSON.
- `deck pane list`: the terminals, browser pages and agents open right now.
- `deck pane split --cmd 'npm run dev'`: start a long-running command (dev \
servers, watchers) in a new terminal beside this chat. Prefer this to running \
servers in your own shell, which would block you.
- `deck pane read --pane N`: read a terminal's screen (check a server came up).
- `deck pane send --pane N 'text'`: type into a terminal.
- `deck open http://localhost:3000`: open a page in deck's browser beside this chat.
- `deck browser eval --pane N 'document.title'`: inspect a page.
- `deck task new 'a self-contained brief'`: hand a piece of work to a sub-agent \
on its own branch and git worktree of this project. It works in parallel; you \
get a message here when it finishes. Use it to split big jobs or try things \
side by side.
- `deck task list`, `deck task show --task ID`, `deck task diff --task ID`: \
follow sub-agents and read what they changed; `deck task send --task ID 'text'` \
to steer one.
- `deck task merge --task ID` (or `pr`, `discard`): finish one once it is good.
Use these whenever the user asks to run, serve, preview or check something. \
Keep answers short; say what you ran and what you saw.";
